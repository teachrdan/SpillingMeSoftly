# Spilling Me Softly
## Visualizing Pipeline Spill Data around the US

There's more than 2,000,000 miles of pipelines in the US. They carry oil, kerosene, jet fuel and other toxic substances - and they often fail, leak and even explode. Spilling Me Softly is a web app that visualizes pipeline spill data around the US. 

For the first time, you'll be able to see exactly how close these leaks happen to you and the places you love. "This data used to live exclusively on government servers. Now it's available to everyone," said Dan Tennery-Spalding, an Oakland-based software developer.

Learning exactly what spilled where has never been easier. Clone Spilling Me Softly and see for yourself.
