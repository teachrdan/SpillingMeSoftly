(R&M) ENTERED THE WEST YARD SECTION OF THE PHILADELPHIA REFINERY AND DISCOVERED A RELEASE OF HEAVY OIL AROUND A VALVE MANIFOLD WHICH CONNECTS THE FM-1 PIPELINE TO THE N-8 PIPELINE.  THE CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEE NOTIFIED SUNOCO PERSONNEL AND A RESPONSE WAS INITIATED.  THE VACUUM GAS OIL (VGO) TRANSFER WAS SHUTDOWN AT 14:00 HOURS AND, DUE TO THE HIGH VISCOSITY OF THE PRODUCT, THE HEAVY MATERIAL WAS IMMEDIATELY DISPLACED FROM THE PIPELINE WITH LIGHT CYCLE OIL (LCO) AND ISOLATED BY 18:00 HOURS. ON 4/5/2010, THE SOURCE OF THE RELEASE WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE BEEN A FLANGED CONNECTION ON THE FM-1 PIG TRAP, NORMALLY ISOLATED, EXCEPT DURING PIGGING ACTIVITY.  THE PIG TRAP WAS LAST USED DURING AN IN-LINE INSPECTION CONDUCTED ON JUNE 23, 2008.  A MORE THOROUGH EVALUATION WILL BE PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY THE FAILURE MECHANISM THAT RESULTED IN THE RELEASE FROM THE FLANGED CONNECTION. A HYDROCHEM (VACUUM TRUCK) EMPLOYEE, WHO ROUTINELY MONITORED AND MANAGED RESIDUAL OIL THAT ACCUMULATED IN REFINERY SUMPS, INCLUDING THE WEST YARD VALVE MANIFOLD VAULT, REPORTED THAT OIL ACCUMULATION APPEARED TO INTENSIFY AND WAS FOUND OUTSIDE THE VAULT BEGINNING ABOUT 3/15/2010.  THIS WAS BELIEVED TO BE CAUSED BY TYPICAL RESIDUAL GROUND SEEPAGE EXACERBATED BY EXCESSIVE RAINFALL AND SNOW THAW.  OPERATIONS TURNOVER REPORTS FROM 3/15/10 TO 3/25/10 HAVE ONLY ONE REPORT OF HEAVY OIL ON WATER (3/18/10).  THIS AGAIN WAS REMOVED BY HYDROCHEM VACUUM TRUCKS.   ON THE MORNING OF 3/16/2010 , TWO SUNOCO EMPLOYEES WERE IN THE WEST YARD FOR TRAINING PURPOSES AND DID NOT NOTICE A LEAK OR HEAVY OIL AT THAT TIME.  ON 3/24/2010 AT 11:00 HOURS, ANOTHER SUNOCO EMPLOYEE WAS IN THE WEST YARD AND DID NOT REPORT A RELEASE AT THAT TIME. IN ADDITION, ON 3/24 AT 13:37 HOURS, A HYDROCHEM EMPLOYEE ENTERED THE WEST YARD TO VACUUM RESIDUAL OIL FROM THE VALVE MANIFOLD VAULT.  THE RELEASE IS BELIEVED TO HAVE STARTED IN THE 24 HOURS PRIOR TO DISCOVERY. A TOTAL OF 1,700 BARRELS WAS RELEASED AND NEARLY ALL OF THE MATERIAL HAS BEEN RECOVERED. 5/19/2010 UPDATE:  THE FM-1 PIG TRAP WAS ABOUT 39 1/2﾿ IN LENGTH, MEASURED FROM THE FLANGE AT THE INLET/OUTLET VALVE TO THE FLANGE AT THE CLOSURE.  THE TRAP WAS INITIALLY SUPPORTED AT THREE LOCATIONS.  THE TRAP WAS SUPPORTED AT THE CONTAINMENT WALL AROUND THE MANIFOLD, 9﾿-4﾿ FROM THE FLANGE AT THE CLOSURE.  THE TRAP WAS ALSO SUPPORTED BY ITS FLANGED CONNECTION TO THE INLET/OUTLET VALVE.  DUE TO ITS LENGTH, IT WAS ALSO SUPPORTED, ADJACENT TO THE FAILED CENTER FLANGE.  THE CENTER FLANGE WAS 5﾿-0﾿ FROM THE INLET/OUTLET VALVE.  THE CENTER SUPPORT IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN LOCATED IN THE 5﾿ SPOOL, WITHIN 12﾿ FROM THE CENTER FLANGE.  THE SUPPORT CONSISTED OF A STRUCTURAL COLUMN, A BASE PLATE AT THE BOTTOM THAT RESTED ON THE FLOOR OF THE MANIFOLD CONTAINMENT, AND A TWO-PART CLAMP-STYLE FITTING AT THE TOP WHICH SECURED THE SUPPORT TO THE OUTSIDE DIAMETER OF THE CARRIER PIPE.  ONCE THE FM-1 TRAP WAS REMOVED, THE CENTER SUPPORT WAS FOUND IN THE CONTAINMENT, DETACHED AND SEPARATED FROM THE FM-1 TRAP PIPING. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE LACK OF SUPPORT AT THE CENTER FLANGE, ALLOWED PIPE MOVEMENT OVER TIME, INCLUDING MOVEMENT CAUSED BY THERMAL CYCLING, WHICH APPLIED A DIFFERENTIAL STRESS ON THE FLANGE BOLTS AND EVENTUALLY CAUSED THE FLANGE TO OPEN AT THE 8:00 O﾿CLOCK POSITION.  THE FM-1 TRAP INLET/OUTLET VALVE WAS FOUND TO HAVE A MECHANICAL DEFECT WHICH PREVENTED A TIGHT SHUT-OFF, WHICH ALLOWED PRODUCT FROM THE FM-1 PIPELINE TRANSFER TO PASS THROUGH THE VALVE, INTO THE PIG TRAP, CAUSING THE RELEASE FROM THE CENTER FLANGE.  NO CORROSION OF THE FLANGE FACES OR OTHER MECHANICAL DAMAGE WAS OBSERVED."

THE PIPELINE WAS NOT OPERATING, AND THE PIPELINE OPERATORS ISOLATED THE LEAK FROM THE OIL STORAGE TANKS. APPROXIMATELY 12,000 GAL ULTIMATELY LEAKED TO A DIKED AREA. LATER, APPROXIMATELY 8,000 GAL OF THIS OIL WAS RECOVERED AND RETURNED TO THE STORAGE TANKS. MITIGATION OF CONTAMINATED SOIL HAS BEEN COMPLETED. NO SURFACE WATERS OR GROUND WATERS WERE AFFECTED BY THE SPILL. THE FAILED GASKET WAS CAREFULLY ACCESSED AND EXAMINED TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF FAILURE. THE GASKET WAS GARLOCK IFG-5500 AND WAS DETERMINED TO BE A PRODUCT SUITABLE FOR THIS APPLICATION. IT HAD NOT BEEN IMPROPERLY INSTALLED AND SHOULD NOT HAVE FAILED AT LESS THAN 110% OF MAXIMUM OPERATING PRESSURE. MAXIMUM OPERATING PRESSURE IS 960 PSIG. THE FAILED JOINT HAD BEEN SUCCESSFULLY HYDO TESTED ABOVE 1350 PSIG IN 2005. A ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS HAS BEEN COMPLETED AND DETERMINED THAT A SMALL SECTION (APPROXIMATELY 9 FT) OF ABOVE GROUND PIPING WAS ISOLATED BY CLOSED VALVES. THIS UN-INSULATED BLACK PIPE HEATED IN THE SUN CAUSING A PRESSURE RISE THAT RESULTED IN THE GASKET FAILURE. THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT WAS INADEQUATE PROCEDURAL GUIDANCE THAT ALLOWED THE SECTION OF PIPING TO BE ISOLATED. SINCE THE FAILED GASKET WAS ISOLATED FROM THE FLOW METERS AND PRESSURE INSTRUMENTS THAT FEED THE SCADA AND LEAK DETECTION SYSTEMS, THERE WAS NO CONTROL SYSTEM INDICATION OF A LEAK. FOLLOWING THE GASKET FAILURE, TANK HEAD PRESSURE ALLOWED FLOW THROUGH A CHECK VALVE AND OUT THOUGH THE FAILED GASKET. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS INCLUDE: GASKET MATERIAL THAT WAS NOT PER SPECIFICATION, FAILURE TO INVESTIGATE PRIOR MINOR FLANGE LEAKS AND AMBIENT HEATING INCIDENTS AND APPLY THE LESSONS LEARNED, LIGHTING THAT WAS PARTIALLY NON-FUNCTIONAL, AND CHANGES IN PIPELINE OPERATIONS THAT HAVE RESULTED IN EXTENDED PIPELINE SHUTDOWNS. GASKETS HAVE BEEN REPLACED AT 39 LOCATIONS WHERE THE INSTALLED GASKETS DID NOT APPEAR TO BE PER SPECIFICATION. TWO STANDING ORDERS HAVE BEEN ISSUED TO PROVIDE INTERIM GUIDANCE WHILE IMPROVED PROCEDURES AND TRAINING ARE BEING DEVELOPED. ONE STANDING ORDER REQUIRES MORE FREQUENT PATROLS TO ASSURE THAT THAT ANY POTENTIAL LEAKS WOULD BE DETECTED MORE QUICKLY.

EXPLORERS INVESTIGATION AND THIRD-PARTY METALLURGICAL TESTING CONCLUDED THAT THE DIRECT CAUSE OF THE 16 INCH STATION PIPING RELEASE WAS FROM THE PIPING BEING ISOLATED FROM THERMAL RELIEF.   A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE RELEASE WAS MICROBIAL INFLUENCED INTERNAL CORROSION. THE METALLURGICAL TEST ALSO INDICATED A CRACK LIKE FLAW HAD ADVANCED IN THE THROUGH-WALL DIRECTION, BUT DID NOT PRODUCE A LEAK OR RUPTURE PRIOR TO THE FINAL FAILURE.  AT THE TIME OF THE RELEASE, THE 12 INCH PIPELINE THAT DELIVERS PRODUCT TO THE FAUNA STATION WAS SHUTDOWN AND THERE WAS 113 PSIG ON THE PIPELINE.  THE 16 INCH STATION PIPING THAT RECEIVES PRODUCT FROM THE 12 INCH PIPELINE WAS ISOLATED FROM THE PIPELINE AND TANKAGE.  HOWEVER, WHEN THE 16 INCH STATION PIPING WAS ISOLATED IT WAS ISOLATED FROM THERMAL RELIEF. THE PRESSURE TRANSMITTER FOR DELIVERIES INTO THE STATION FROM THE 12 INCH PIPELINE IS UPSTREAM OF THE FIRST MANUAL ISOLATION VALVE THAT WAS SHUT.  THEREFORE, THE EXACT PRESSURE ON THE 971 FOOT SECTION OF 16 INCH STATION PIPING INVOLVED WITH THE INCIDENT IS UNKNOWN. THE 16 INCH STATION PIPING WAS TO BE DECOMMISSIONED FOLLOWING THE COMPLETION OF THE NEW 24 INCH CONNECTION AND MANIFOLD AT FAUNA. THE NEW 24 INCH STATION MANIFOLD CONNECTION INTO THE FAUNA STATION WAS ISOLATED FROM THE NEW 24 INCH PIPELINE CONNECTION.  AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, EXPLORER WAS BYPASSING THE FAUNA STATION AND WAS MAKING A DELIVERY TO A THIRD-PARTY PIPELINE.  THE 24 INCH STATION MANIFOLD PRESSURE WAS 3.6 PSIG DURING THE DELIVERY TO THE THIRD-PARTY PIPELINE. THE 24 INCH SYSTEM AND MANIFOLD IS A NEW OPERATION THAT HAD ESTABLISHED DELIVERY AND RECEIPT PROCEDURES.   THE 24 INCH PIPELINE DELIVERY WAS IMMEDIATELY SHUTDOWN TO ALLOW FIELD PERSONNEL TO RESPOND TO THE STATION RELEASE THAT WAS TOTALLY CONTAINED INSIDE THE DIKE.  THE BURST PRESSURE OF THE REGION OF THE WALL LOSS THAT CONTAINED THE RUPTURE WAS CALCULATED USING THE RSTRENG EFFECTIVE AREA METHOD EMBODIED IN CORLAS AND RANGED FROM 342 PSIG TO 787 PSIG. THE 971 FOOT SECTION OF 16 INCH STATION PIPING INVOLVED WAS FROM ORIGINAL 1954 CONSTRUCTION OF THE FAUNA STATION AND LIMITED DATA WAS PROVIDED FROM THE PREVIOUS OWNER.  HOWEVER, METALLURGICAL TESTING CONFIRMED THE 16 INCH STATION PIPING WAS API 5L  .250 INCH WALL THICKNESS X46 ELECTRIC FUSION WELDED (EFW) LONGITUDINAL SEAM PIPE.   THE 16 INCH FUANA STATION PIPING DECOMMISSIONING HAS BEEN COMPLETED AND THE PIPING WAS DISPLACED WITH NITROGEN.   REPORT WAS SUPPLMENTED TO ACCOUNT FOR QUESTION E5F."

A PIPELINE OPERATOR WAS SENT TO INVESTIGATE AND CONFIRM IF NUSTAR'S PIPELINE WAS INVOVLED. AT  1447 HRS.  THE PIPELINE OPERATOR CONCLUDES THAT THE WET SPOT IS DUE TO A RELEASE IN A COMMON ROW WITH OTHER PIPELINE OPERATIORS AND NOTIFIES THE AREA PIPELINE MANAGER. THE PIPELINE WAS SHUT DOWN AND RESPONSE PERSONNEL WITH EQUIPMENT WERE CALLED TO THE SITE. AT 1447 HRS. EXCAVATION ACTIVITIES WERE BEGUN AND THE NRC AND RAILROAD COMMISSION WERE NOTIFIED OF A POSSIBLE RELEASE ON NUSTAR'S PIPELINE.   AT 1955 HRS.

THE LEAKING PORTION OF THE PIPELINE HAS BEEN REPLACED AND THE PIPE SPECIMEN IS BEING SHIPPED TO KIEFNER AND ASSOCIATES, INC. FOR THIRD PARTY ANALYSIS, AFTER WHICH, A LABORATORY REPORT WILL BE ISSUED. AT THAT TIME THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK WILL BE KNOWN AND A FINAL 7000.1 FORM WILL BE SUBMITTED. UPDATE: CAUSE OF THE RELEASE & SEQUENCE OF EVENTS  AN OUTSIDE CONSULTANT, KIEFNER & ASSOCIATES HAS INVESTIGATED THE SOURCE OF THE FAILURE AND CONCLUDED THAT THE LEAK OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF CRACK PROPAGATION DUE TO PRESSURE-CYCLING FATIGUE.  THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF DISBONDMENT OR ACTIVE CORROSION BETWEEN THE AQUAWRAP BONDING MATERIAL AND THE PIPELINE ITSELF, INDICATING THAT AN INITIAL MICROSCOPIC CRACK PRE-EXISTED THE INSTALLTION OF THE AQUAWRAP AND PROPAGATED TO FAILURE.

THE PINHOLE WAS CUTOUT TO ALLOW FOR MORE PRODUCT TO DRAIN BACK INTO THE TANK FROM THE SURROUNDING SOIL, WHERE IS WAS RECOVERED.  AS OF JANUARY 13, 2011, APPROXIMATELY 1146 GALLONS OF PRODUCT HAS BEEN RECOVERED.  NO PRODUCT IS BELIEVED TO HAVE ESCAPED THE TANK FARM'S SECONDARY CONTAINMENT DUE TO CONSTRUCTION OF AN IMPERVIOUS CLAY LINER WITHIN THE TANK DIKES, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FACILITY'S NEW JERSEY DISCHARGE PREVENTION, CONTAINMENT, AND COUNTERMEASURES PLAN (NJ DPCC). METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS CONCLUDED THAT THROUGH-WALL CORROSION OCCURRED FROM THE PRODUCT SIDE OF THE SUMP PLATE.  THE CORROSION MECHANISM IS CONSISTENT WITH GALVANIC CORROSION THAT WAS ACCELERATED BY IMPACT FROM GAUGING AND PRODUCT SAMPLING EQUIPMENT.  THE GAUGING AND/OR PRODUCT SAMPLING EQUIPMENT ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE INITIALLY DAMAGED THE TANK INTERNAL COATING, RESULTING IN CORROSION INITIATION.  ENTRAINED WATER WITHIN THE REFINED PETROLEUM PRODUCTS IS BELIEVED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CORROSIVE ENVIRONMENT WITHIN THE SUMP.  CORROSION PRODUCTS THAT FORMED ON THE EXPOSED STEEL WERE DAMAGED BY THE GAUGING/SAMPLING EQUIPMENT, EXPOSING FRESH STEEL AND RESULTING IN ACCELERATION OF THE CORROSION.  MICROBIOLOGICALLY INFLUENCED CORROSION (MIC) IS NOT BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE THROUGH-WALL CORROSION."

THE FLOW INDICATOR WAS INSTALLED IN 2007 AND LEAKED IN FEBRUARY 2011.  THE ANALYSIS INCLUDED VISUAL EXAMINATION, ANALYSIS OF DEPOSITS AND CORROSION PRODUCTS,  DISASSEMBLY AND SECTIONING, ABRASIVE BLASTING, STEREOMICROSCOPY, CHEMICAL ANALYSIS, AND ELECTRON  MICROSCOPY. THE FAILURE WAS CAUSED BY SEVERE INTERNAL CORROSION, WHICH REDUCED THE WALL  THICKNESS OF THE 2024 ALUMINUM ALLOY BODY TO THE POINT THAT IT COULD NOT WITHSTAND THE PRESSURE OF  THE FLUID. THE FLUIDS THAT NORMALLY FLOW THROUGH THE FLOW INDICATOR ARE NOT CORROSIVE TO  ALUMINUM. THE MATERIAL RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CORROSION WAS MOST LIKELY A CONTAMINANT THAT HAD  RECENTLY BEEN REMOVED FROM THE BOTTOM OF AN UPSTREAM TANK. THIS CONTAMINANT CORRODED THE  ALUMINUM LEGS THAT SUPPORTED THE ROOF OF THIS TANK AND REPORTEDLY FLOWED THROUGH THE FLOW  INDICATOR. THE PH OF THE DEPOSITS/CORROSION PRODUCTS WAS MODERATELY ALKALINE. THE  DEPOSITS/CORROSION PRODUCTS CONTAINED SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS OF SODIUM AND SULFUR. THE  CONTAMINANT COULD HAVE CONTAINED SODIUM HYDROXIDE, WHICH IS HIGHLY CORROSIVE TO ALUMINUM.  THE CORROSIVE CONTAMINANT COULD HAVE ALSO BEEN SODIUM DITHIONITE OR ANOTHER SODIUM-SULFUR  COMPOUND. IF ANY OF THE CONTAMINANT IS STILL AVAILABLE, IT COULD BE CHEMICALLY ANALYZED TO  IDENTIFY THE SPECIFIC COMPOUNDS THAT ARE PRESENT. THIS INFORMATION COULD BE USED TO IDENTIFY THE  SOURCE OF THE CONTAMINANT AND PREVENT FUTURE ACCUMULATIONS IN THE STORAGE TANK. OTHER  EQUIPMENT THAT WAS EXPOSED TO THE CONTAMINANT SHOULD BE INSPECTED TO INSURE THAT EXCESSIVE  CORROSION DID NOT OCCUR."

EAST OPERATOR (EMPLOYEE #1) CONTACTED THE WEST OPERATOR (EMPLOYEE #2) TO LET HIM KNOW HE WAS GOING TO DO A LINE WASH ON THE GREEN LINE FROM THE EAST STATION TO THE WEST STATION. EMPLOYEE #2 LINED UP HIS STATION TO RECEIVE THE LINE WASH ON THE GREEN LINE. THE EMPLOYEE #1 INCORRECTLY LINED UP HIS STATION TO DELIVER DOWN THE SHELL LINE. EMPLOYEE #1 STARTED UP THE PUMP AND CONTACTED THE WEST OPERATOR TO SEE IF HE HAD STARTED RECEIVING OIL. THE EMPLOYEE #2 ADVISED HIM NO AND AT THAT TIME EMPLOYEE #1 LOOKED AT HIS SECURITY MONITOR AND OBSERVED A LARGE LEAK IN THE MANIFOLD. EMPLOYEE #1 IMMEDIATELY STARTED SHUTTING EVERYTHING DOWN AND CLOSING VALVES. WHEN THE LEAK WAS DUG OUT IT WAS DISCOVERED THE LINE THAT WAS LEAKING WAS THE 8 INCH SHELL LINE AND NOT THE 22 INCH GREEN LINE THAT THE DELIVERY SHOULD HAVE BEEN GOING TO.  DURING THE INVESTIGATION IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE HIGH PRESSURE SHUT DOWN DID NOT SHUT THE PUMP DOWN NOR DID THE STATION INDICATE ANY HIGH PRESSURE ALARMS DURING THE 15 MINUTE TIME SPAN THAT THE PUMP WAS RUNNING. IN LOOKING AT THE DATA AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT THE PRESSURE ON THE LINE SHOWED TO REACH 137 PSI. THE HIGH PRESSURE SHUT DOWN ON THE PUMP IS 271 PSI. THE PUMP PRESSURE SHUTDOWN WAS TESTED AND FOUND TO BE WORKING CORRECTLY. ALSO THE MANIFOLD WAS NOT LABELED DUE TO RECENTLY BEING PAINTED. OPERATIONS WAS IN THE PROCESS OF RE-LABELING THE MANIFOLD. THE GREEN LINE VALVE AND THE SHELL LINE VALVE ARE SIDE BY SIDE, BUT THE GREEN LINE VALVE IS A 10 INCH MOV AND THE SHELL LINE IS A 6 INCH MANUAL OPERATOR VALVE. THERE WAS NOT A PROCEDURE FOR A LINE WASH FROM THE EAST TO THE WEST. AFTER EXCAVATION IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE LINE HAD A SPLIT DOWN THE SEAM OF THE PIPE APPROXIMATELY 49 INCHES IN THE 3 O﾿CLOCK POSITION. THE PIPE WILL BE CUT OUT AND SENT FOR ANALYSIS. UPDATE 1/18/2012 - UPDATED FINAL COST.  LAB REPORT ON PIPE AND INCIDENT REPORT CONCERNING THIS LEAK WAS FORWARDED TO PHMSA ON 6/20/2011. PART G5, PART 2 - OTHER - THE CAUSE OF FAILURE WAS OVERHEATING OF THE EDGES OF THE SKELP DURING THE LAP WELDING PROCESS CAUSING GAIN GROWTH AND INTERGRANULAR CRACKS.  THE SERVICE CONDITIONS OF THE PIPE CAUSED THE CRACKS TO CONNECT OVER TIME AND EVENTUALLY REDUCE THE EFFECTIVE WALL THICKNESS OF THE PIPE TO THE POINT WHERE IT WAS UNABLE TO WITHSTAND THE HOOP STRESS."

"YES"	31.960602	-102.617793	"AN INITIAL INVESTIGATION OF THIS INCIDENT INDICATES THAT THE RELEASE WAS DUE TO THE ACTIVATION OF A THERMAL RELIEF VALVE WHICH FAILED TO RE-SEAT BECAUSE OF THE FOREIGN DEBRIS ON THE VALVE SEAT.  THE FLOW RATE FROM THE THERMAL RELIEF VALVE EXCEEDED THE SUMP CAPACITY CAUSING IT TO OVERFLOW.  AN ALARM ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SUMP FAILED TO ACTIVATE.  THE THERMAL RELIEF VALVE WAS REPLACED AND RE-PIPED TO RELIEVE INTO A STORAGE TANK RATHER THAN A SUMP.  THE FAILURES RELATED TO THIS INCIDENT ARE STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION. SUPPLEMENTAL NARRATIVE. AS DESCRIBED IN THE INITIAL REPORT, THIS INCIDENT WAS CAUSED BY THE FAILURE OF A THERMAL RELIEF VALVE TO RE-SEAT AFTER ACTIVATING.  THE THERMAL RELIEF VALVE IS INSTALLED BETWEEN A PUMP DISCHARGE AND BACK PRESSURE CONTROL VALVE.  THE CONTROL VALVE WAS ORIGINALLY AIR OPERATED.  DUE TO EXCESSIVE MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS, THE OLD CONTROL VALVE WAS REPLACED BY A NEW, ELECTRIC MOTOR OPERATED VALVE.   WHEN THE ELECTRIC OPERATED VALVE WAS INSTALLED, THE ELECTRONIC TECHNICIAN SET THE VALVE TO CLOSE COMPLETELY WHEN THE PIPELINE PUMP WAS STOPPED.  THE AIR OPERATED CONTROL VALVE DID NOT CLOSE COMPLETELY WHEN THE PIPELINE PUMP WAS STOPPED. THUS, AFTER THE ELECTRIC OPERATED CONTROL VALVE WAS INSTALLED, THE PUMP WAS STARTING AGAINST A SHUT VALVE.  THIS REDUCED THE STARTING CURRENT IN THE PUMP MOTOR BUT ALSO CAUSED THE PRESSURE IN THE LINE BETWEEN THE PUMP AND VALVE TO RISE TO A LEVEL THAT CAUSED THE THERMAL RELIEF VALVE TO ACTIVATE UNTIL THE CONTROL VALVE OPENED ENOUGH TO REDUCE THE PRESSURE TO ALLOW THE THERMAL RELIEF TO RE-SEAT.   THE RELIEF VALVE SETTING IS 550 PSIG, THE MOP OF THE LINE IS 800 PSIG AND THE PUMP SHUTOFF HEAD IS 620 PSIG.  THIS STARTUP PROCEDURE WAS OCCURRING FOR SOME TIME PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT.  THE REPEATED ACTIVATION OF THE RELIEF VALVE DURING SYSTEM STARTUP COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO IT NOT RE-SEATING. THE FLOW RATE FROM THE THERMAL RELIEF NOT RE-SEATING EXCEEDED THE CAPACITY OF THE SMALL SUMP PUMP.  THIS RESULTED IN A CONTINUALLY RISING LEVEL IN THE SUMP WHICH ULTIMATELY OVERFLOWED, CAUSING THE RELEASE.  ALTHOUGH EQUIPPED WITH A HIGH SUMP LEVEL ALARM, THE ALARM FAILED TO ALERT THE CONTROL ROOM OPERATOR BECAUSE THE ALARM FLOAT BECAME STUCK CAUSING THE ALARM SWITCH NOT TO ACTIVATE. AFTER A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION OF THIS INCIDENT, SEVERAL ACTIONS WERE TAKEN TO PREVENT THE RECURRENCE OF THIS TYPE OF INCIDENT. -A REVIEW OF THE STARTUP PROTOCOL FOR THIS SYSTEM WAS CONDUCTED.  AS A RESULT THE CONTROL VALVE SETTING WAS CHANGED SO THAT THE VALVE DID NOT SHUT COMPLETELY WHEN THE PUMP IS SHUTDOWN.  THIS IS ALLOWING FLOW THROUGH THE VALVE UPON STARTUP AND MAINTAINING THE PRESSURE UPSTREAM OF THE VALVE BELOW THE SETTING OF THE THERMAL RELIEF VALVE;  -A " EXCESSIVE RUN TIME" ALARM FEATURE WAS INSTALLED ON THE SUMP PUMP TO ALERT THE CONTROL ROOM OPERATOR WHEN THE SUMP PUMP IS RUNNING LONGER THAN - NORMAL; AND   -A NEW THERMAL RELIEF VALVE WAS INSTALLED AND ITS DISCHARGE RE-PIPED TO RELIEF INTO A STORAGE TANK RATHER THAN THE SMALL SUMP."

"YES"	32.080874	-103.176847	"ON DECEMBER 8, 2011, THREE PLAINS EMPLOYEES WERE PERFORMING ROUTINE MAINTENANCE TO REPLACE A TANK MIXER ON A 77,000 BARREL INTERNAL FLOATING ROOF TANK STORING WEST TEXAS INTERMEDIATE (WTI) CRUDE OIL.  PRIOR TO CHANGING THE TANK MIXER, THE LEVEL OF WTI IN THE TANK WAS LOWERED BELOW THE BOTTOM OF THE MIXER MAN WAY TO PERFORM THIS MAINTENANCE.  THE ISOLATION VALVE IN THE INCOMING TANK SUPPLY LINE WAS CLOSED, TAGGED AND LOCKED OUT.  THE BREAKER TO THE MIXER MOTOR WAS ALSO OPENED, TAGGED AND LOCKED OUT. THE CREW ALSO COMPLETED A WORK AUTHORIZATION PERMIT AS REQUIRED TO PERFORM THIS TASK. THE CREW BEGAN REMOVING THE EXISTING MIXER.  IN ORDER TO REMOVE THE OLD MIXER FROM THE TANK, A ONE TON DIESEL POWERED MECHANIC'S TRUCK WAS BACKED APPROXIMATELY 18-INCHES FROM THE MIXER IN ORDER TO USE THE CRANE MOUNTED ON THE BACK OF THE TRUCK TO LIFT THE MIXERS.  PRIOR TO POSITIONING THE TRUCK NEAR THE MIXER, A VOC SURVEY OF THE WORK AREA INDICATED NO PRESENCE OF A HAZARDOUS ATMOSPHERE.  THE TRUCK WAS LEFT RUNNING WHEN REMOVAL OF THE MIXER FROM THE TANK BEGAN.  WHEN THE MIXER WAS PULLED FROM THE MAN WAY MOUNTING FLANGE OF THE TANK, VOC VAPORS EMANATED FROM THE TANK AND ENVELOPED THE WORK AREA, INCLUDING THE MECHANIC'S TRUCK.  AT THE TIME THE MIXER MOVED FROM THE MAN WAY FLANGE, THE GAS MONITOR WORN BY ONE OF THE WORKERS ALARMED.  THE WORKER STEPPED BACK FROM THE MAN WAY UNTIL THE ALARM CLEARED.  THE MECHANIC﾿S TRUCK ALSO BEGAN TO BACK FIRE, RACE, AND SURGE OUT OF CONTROL FROM THE HYDROCARBON RICH ATMOSPHERE.  THE TRUCK'S IGNITION WAS TURNED OFF BUT THE TRUCK CONTINUED TO RUN.  FEARFUL FOR THEIR SAFETY, THE THREE EMPLOYEES FLED FROM THE AREA.  JUST AS THE EMPLOYEES FLED, THE HYDROCARBON VAPOR CLOUD FLASHED FROM THE TRUCK IGNITION SOURCE CAUSING AN EXPLOSION AND FIRE.  THE EXPLOSION RESULTED IN THE TANK AND TRUCK BEING SET ON FIRE. THE JAL, NEW MEXICO VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS IMMEDIATELY CALLED BY ONE OF THE EMPLOYEES INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT.  THE JAL FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS FIRST TO ARRIVE AT THE SCENE APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES AFTER THE INCIDENT AND THE EUNICE, N. MEXICO FIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVED A SHORT TIME LATER.  THE FIRE WAS EXTINGUISHED AT 1110MST. TWO EMPLOYEES WERE TAKEN BY AMBULANCE TO WINKLER COUNTY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL FOR PRECAUTIONARY MEDICAL EVALUATIONS.  ONE EMPLOYEE SUFFERED A SECOND DEGREE BURN AND BLISTERING TO THE BACK OF HIS NECK AND A SECOND EMPLOYEE SUFFERED MINOR BRUISING FROM BEING KNOCKED TO THE GROUND BY THE EXPLOSION.  AFTER RECEIVING MEDICAL EVALUATIONS, THE TWO EMPLOYEES WERE ALLOWED TO RETURN TO WORK. UPON DETERMINING THE STATUS OF THE INJURIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCIDENT, A TELEPHONIC NOTIFICATION WAS MADE TO NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (1043 MST) AND WAS ASSIGNED NRC REPORT NO.  997554. AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THE EXPLOSION AND FIRE WAS A RESULT OF FLAMMABLE VAPORS REACHING A SOURCE OF IGNITION DURING THE REPLACEMENT OF A TANK MIXER.  THE EXPLOSION AND FIRE WAS DUE TO OPERATOR PERSONNEL FAILING TO FOLLOW REQUIRED MAINTENANCE AND SAFETY PROCEDURES AND POLICIES WHEN PERFORMING WORK WITHIN AN AREA WITH A POTENTIAL HAZARDOUS ATMOSPHERE. THE FIRE DESTROYED THE PICKUP AND CAUSED EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO THE TANK INCLUDING DISTORTION OF A PORTION OF THE OUTER SHELL AND THE INTERNAL FLOATING ROOF AND HEAVY DAMAGE TO THE EXTERIOR PAINT AND THE OLD MIXER THAT WAS REMOVED.  THE DAMAGED TANK WILL BE DEMOLISHED AND AN EXISTING TANK AT JAL STATION WILL BE USED TO PERFORM THE FUNCTION OF THE DEMOLISHED TANK. TO PREVENT THIS FROM REOCCURRING, PLAINS IS ENHANCING THE CURRENT TRAINING OF THE WORK AUTHORIZATION PERMIT TO INCLUDE STRONG EMPHASIS ON PROCEDURES FOR ATMOSPHERIC MONITORING AND IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL IGNITION SOURCES IN WORK AREAS.  IN ADDITION, DURING FUTURE WORK, ATMOSPHERIC MONITORING WILL BE CONDUCTED WITH A CALIBRATED DIRECT READING INSTRUMENT INITIALLY AND CONTINUOUS MONITORING WILL BE PERFORMED AND DOCUMENTED.  PLAINS PERSONNEL WILL ALSO BE RE-TRAINED ON ATMOSPHERIC MONITORING ALARM PROTO"

THE 8 INCH PROPANE/BUTANE PIPELINE HAD A COMPLETE WELD SEAM FAILURE, RESULTING IN RELEASE OF PROPANE/BUTANE TO THE SURROUNDING SOIL AND ATMOSPHERE.  THE LINE SEGMENT WAS BLOCKED IN AT VALVES LOCATED AT MILE POSTS 47.7 AND MILE POST 58.8. FIELD OPERATIONS SECURED THE AREA, AND BEGAN TAKING STEPS TO CLEAR AND REPAIR THE LINE SEGMENT.  THE RESIDUAL HYDROCARBONS WERE PURGED WITH NITROGEN FROM THE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM VALVE LOCATIONS.  THE AREA WAS EXCAVATED WITH A BACK-HOE TO EXPOSE ENOUGH PIPE TO FACILITATE THE REPAIR.  AFTER THE LINE WAS CONFIRMED TO BE FREE OF HYDROCARBONS, ONSITE CONTRACTORS (S&S CONSTRUCTION) PROCEEDED TO COLD CUT THE EAST SIDE OF THE LINE.  THE FIRST COLD CUT WAS SUCCESSFUL AND APPROXIMATELY 20 FEET OF PIPE WAS REMOVED. TWO ENTERPRISE EMPLOYEES AND FOUR CONTRACTORS WERE IN THE TRENCH WORKING ON VARIOUS TASKS, SUCH AS REMOVING ADDITIONAL SOIL WITH SHOVELS, TAKING MEASUREMENTS AND EVALUATING THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL PIPE THAT NEEDED TO BE REMOVED FROM THE WEST SIDE OF THE WELD FAILURE. AT APPROXIMATELY 5:00PM ON DECEMBER 28, 2011, A FLASH FIRE OCCURRED IN THE TRENCH WHEN A CONCENTRATION OF HYDROCARBONS EXCEEDING THE LOWER FLAMMABILITY LIMIT (LFL) FOR THE HYDROCARBON MIXTURE WAS IGNITED.  FOUR INDIVIDUALS WERE IN THE PROXIMITY OF OF THE FLASH FIRE. ONE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS REQUIRED OVER NIGHT HOSPITALIZATION."

THE 12 INCH BOA PIPELINE OPERATES INTERMITTENTLY TO MAKE SCHEDULED DELIVERIES OF CRUDE OIL.  ON MARCH 17, 2012, A STARTUP OF THE PIPELINE OCCURRED AT 0700.  WHEN A NORMAL OPERATING PRESSURE WAS NOT ACHIEVED UPON STARTUP OF THE PIPELINE, THE PLAINS CONTROL CENTER IMMEDIATELY SHUTDOWN THE PIPELINE (0705)  FIELD PERSONNEL WERE IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED BY THE CONTROL ROOM WHO ARRANGED FOR AN OVER FLIGHT OF THE PIPELINE RIGHT-OF-WAY TO INVESTIGATE THE PROBLEM OF NOT BEING ABLE TO ACHIEVE NORMAL PRESSURE.  THE OVER FLIGHT BEGAN AS SOON AS FOG IN THE AREA LIFTED. AT APPROXIMATELY 1000, AN OIL SHEEN WAS OBSERVED IN BARATARIA PASS AND APPEARED TO BE COMING FROM THE JACK UP LIFT BARGE SEVEN INAGHA WHICH WAS SPUDDED DOWN AND THE DREDGE VESSEL DREDGE TEXAS OWNED BY THE GREAT LAKES DREDGE AND DOCK COMPANY.  AN INSPECTION OF THE AREA CONDUCTED THE PREVIOUS DAY, DID NOT NOTE THE LIFT BARGE OR DREDGE IN THE VICINITY OF THE PIPELINE. AFTER OBSERVING THE OIL SHEEN, NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE TO PLAINS MANAGEMENT, USCG AND LOUISIANA STATE POLICE HAZ MAT.  CONTRACTORS WERE CONTACTED TO BEGIN MOBILIZING TO DETERMINE THE SOURCE OF THE RELEASE.  A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR WAS ALSO CONTACTED TO INVESTIGATE THE OIL SLICK WHICH APPEARED TO BE EMANATING NEAR OR AROUND THE JACK UP VESSEL. A MAGNETOMETER SURVEY SHOWED THE 12-INCH BOA PIPELINE WAS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 600 FEET OFF OF THE LIFT BARGE SEVEN INAGHA PORT SIDE AND NORTH OF THE VESSEL.  MULTI SCANNING OF THE SEA BOTTOM INDICATED NO EVIDENCE THAT THE SEVEN INAGHA SPUDS CAME INTO CONTACT WITH THE PIPELINE.  THE CAPTAIN OF SEVEN INAGHA DID NOT NOTIFY ONE-CALL, BUT DID NOTIFY THE USCG WHEN A SHEEN WAS OBSERVED AROUND HIS VESSEL. FROM THE MULTI SCAN IMAGING AND OTHER INVESTIGATION DATA, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE DREDGE VESSEL DREDGE TEXAS STRUCK THE BOA 12-INCH PIPELINE WITH ITS CUTTER HEAD WHEN IT WAS LOWERED TO HELP STOP THE FORWARD MOTION OF THE DREDGE TO CONDUCT MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES.  SEA BOTTOM IMAGES CLEARLY SHOW THE CRATER FORMED BY DROPPING THE CUTTER HEAD INTERSECTING THE PIPELINE ALIGNMENT.  THE DREDGE WAS FOUND ANCHORED ABOVE THE PIPELINE.  A PLAINS PIPELINE MARKER IDENTIFYING A PIPELINE CROSSING AND WARNING DO NOT ANCHOR OR DREDGE WAS CLEARLY VISIBLE TO DREDGE TEXAS.  DREDGE TEXAS DID NOT MAKE A ONE-CALL NOTIFICATION FOR DREDGING ACTIVITIES IN THE LOCATION WHERE THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED. APPROXIMATELY 204 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL WAS RELEASED AND SIX FEET OF THE PIPELINE WAS DAMAGED.  TO REPAIR THE PIPE, A CLAMP DEVICE WAS CONSTRUCTED TO SUPPORT THE DAMAGED PIPE IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE LIFTED TO A HEIGHT SUFFICIENT TO MAKE REPAIRS.  UPON REMOVAL OF THE CLAMP IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THE DAMAGE WAS A RESULT OF THE CUTTER HEAD.

THE WELDING INSPECTOR REMOVED ALL PERSONNEL FROM THE EXCAVATION SITE AND CALLED PIPELINE CONTROL TO SHUT DOWN THE PIPELINE.  THE LEAK WAS THEN ISOLATED BETWEEN AM 32 AND AM 35 AND THE REMAINING PRODUCTS WERE FLARED.  ONCE THE AREA WAS MADE SAFE, THE LINE WAS EXPOSED TO EXTEND THE LENGTH OF EXCAVATION TO CUT-OUT AND REPLACE THE PIPE.  THE LINE WAS PURGED AND RESTARTED ON 11/8/2012. PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS  THE CUT-OUT SECTION WAS SENT TO A LAB FOR EXAMINATION.  PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION OF THE PIPE CUT-OUT VIA MACRO-SECTIONING DETERMINED THERE ARE NO LAMINATIONS, SEGREGATIONS, AND / OR ANOMALIES WITHIN THE BODY OF THE PIPE.  PRE & POST INCIDENT NON-DESTRUCTIVE EXAMINATION VERIFIED WALL THICKNESS MEASUREMENTS OF THE PIPE WERE WITHIN THE APPROVED PARAMETERS.  PHYSICAL MEASUREMENTS USING A MICROMETER OF THE PIPE WERE CONDUCTED AFTER SECTIONING ALSO CONFIRMED THE WALL THICKNESS WAS ACCEPTABLE.  BASED ON INTERVIEWS WITH THE WELDING INSPECTOR AND WELDERS AS WELL AS REVIEWING THE DATA SUBMITTED BY THE WELDING INSPECTOR, THE WELDERS WERE NOT BEING FULLY MONITORED DURING THE WELDING OPERATION. IT HAS ALSO BEEN DETERMINED THAT THE WELDERS WERE WELDING OUTSIDE OF THE SPECIFIED PARAMETER RANGES.  SEVERAL MACRO-SECTIONS WERE TAKEN AND PHOTOGRAPHED FROM AREAS BOTH OUTSIDE AND OF CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE BURN-THROUGH LOCATION.  THE PHOTOGRAPHS INDICATE THAT PREVIOUS PASSES FROM THE RESPONSIBLE WELDER WERE WELDED WITHIN ACCEPTABLE WELDING PARAMETERS.  AS THE MACRO-SECTIONS MOVED CLOSER TO THE BURN-THROUGH LOCATION IT CAN BE NOTED THAT THE OVERALL ENERGY INPUTTED INTO THE PIPE REGION INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY COMPARED TO PREVIOUS PASSES.  A FINAL REPORT IS PENDING FROM THE LAB ANALYSIS. METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS FINDINGS  THE METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS CONCLUDED " THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THIS BURN-THROUGH IS THE POOR WELDING PRACTICE OF THE SUBJECT WELDER.  HE USED EXCESSIVE HEAT INPUT IN HIS WELDING OPERATIONS.  HE CONSISTENTLY DEPOSITED LARGE BEADS AND PENETRATED DEEP INTO THE PIPE.  THIS WAS PARTICULARLY EVIDENT IN THE LAST ROD HE DEPOSITED.". IN REFERENCE TO G7 - INCORRECT OPERATION, THE INVESTIGATION IDENTIFIED THAT ALTHOUGH THE WELDERS WERE QUALIFIED PER ENTERPRISE'S OQ PROGRAM, THE WELDING INSPECTOR'S OQ QUALIFICATIONS RELATED TO THIS TASK EXPIRED AUGUST 10, 2012.  AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT THE WELDING INSPECTOR WAS CERTIFIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH CPWI AND NCCER."

ALL THE PRODUCT WAS CONTAINED ON THE PROPERTY.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL ARRIVED AT THE PUMP STATION NOVEMBER 6, 2012 AT 03:55 CST TO BEGIN RECOVER AND REMEDIATION OPERATIONS.   AT 05:33 CST IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RELEASE WOULD EXCEED $50,000, AT WHICH TIME THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER WAS NOTIFIED AT 07:15AM CST. EXPLORER HAS RECOVERED 156 BARRELS OF FREE PHASE PRODUCT, 417 BARRELS OF WATER FROM VALVE VAULTS INSIDE THE STATION, AND 38 BARRELS OF EMULSION. 720 CUBIC YARDS OF IMPACTED SOIL WAS TESTED FOR PROPER DISPOSED AT A STATE-APPROVED DISPOSAL FACILITY. TWENTY-FIVE POST EXCAVATION SOIL SAMPLES HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO CONFIRM THAT ALL THE RELEASED PRODUCT WAS RECOVERED AND REMOVED. THE MOP FOR THE PUMP SUCTION PRESSURE IS 973 PSIG (ANSI CLASS 400) AND THE PUMP DISCHARGE PRESSURE IS 1,440 PSIG (ANSI CLASS 600). THE DIRECT CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS A THRUST BEARING RETAINING LOCK NUT HAD COME LOOSE ON THE PUMP SHAFT, WHICH ALLOWED THE THRUST OF THE PUMP ROTOR TO PUSH THE SHAFT TOWARDS THE MOTOR. THIS CRUSHED THE SEAL FACES ON ONE OF THE SEALS. MAINTENANCE RECORDS ON THE PUMP INDICATE THAT THE PUMP WAS REMOVED AND TRANSPORTED OFF-SITE FOR A COMPLETE OVERHAUL IN EARLY 2003 BY A LARGE PUMP MANUFACTURE.  EXPLORER PIPELINE RETAINED A THIRD-PARTY PUMP EXPERT TO INSPECT THE PUMP AND THEY CONCLUDED THAT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE FAILURE WAS THE THRUST BEARING RETAINING NUT AND LOCK WASHER WERE INSTALLED INCORRECTLY BY THE PUMP MANUFACTURER DURING THE 2003 OVERHAUL.

FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THE SOURCE OF OIL REVEALED THAT THERE WAS NO CHECK VALVE AND THE RELIEF LINE WAS EXPOSED TO HEAD PRESSURE FROM TANK 13. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE ALTERNATE SAFE DELIVERY OPERATIONS TO EXXON MOBIL AT THE MOKENA FACILITY WHILE THE PRESSURE RELIEF SYSTEM IS OUT OF SERVICE FOR REPAIR, A TEMPORARY PROCEDURE WAS DEVELOPED UNTIL THE RELIEF LINES ARE BACK IN OPERATION.  THE INITIAL PIECE OF FAILED PIPING WAS CUT OUT AND HAS BEEN REPLACED.  IT WAS SUSPECTED AT THE TIME THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE WAS INTERNAL CORROSION, DUE TO THE FAILURE OCCURRING IN A LOW SPOT.  AT THE SAME TIME THIS REPAIR WAS DONE, ENBRIDGE STARTED AN ELEVATION STUDY TO IDENTIFY OTHER LOW SPOTS ON THE RELIEF LINE AND TO DETERMINE IF INTERNAL CORROSION MAY EXIST IN OTHER LOCATIONS.  A DEFECT WAS DISCOVERED DURING SANDBLASTING IN PREPARATION FOR NDE. THAT SEGMENT WAS CUT OUT AND REPLACED.  NDE CONFIRMED PIPE INTEGRITY AT ALL OTHER TESTED LOCATIONS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE LINE NEAR TANK 13, WHICH WAS NOT COMPLETELY EXCAVATED.  A FLANGE AND BLIND WAS INSTALLED TO ISOLATE THE RELIEF LINE UPSTREAM OF THE AFOREMENTIONED PIPING TO TANK 13.  A HYDROTEST WAS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED ON THE SEGMENT OF THE RELIEF LINE TO TANK 11, AND THAT SEGMENT HAS BEEN PLACED BACK INTO SERVICE. REPAIRS CONTINUE AND IT IS ANTICIPATED THEY WILL BE COMPLETE BY THE END OF FIRST QUARTER 2013.  CLEANUP AND RESTORATION OF THE SITE IS IN PROGRESS AND IT IS ANTICIPATED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF JANUARY 2013. UPDATE - 5/7/13  METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS CONFIRMED INTERNAL CORROSION AS THE CAUSE.  REPAIRS, CLEAN UP AND RESTORATION HAVE BEEN COMPLETED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SEPARATE SECTION OF THIS LINE THAT TIES INTO A DIFFERENT TANK AS A BACK-UP IN CASE BP TAKES THEIR TANK OUT OF SERVICE.

THE VALVES WERE REMOVED TO INSTALL BLINDS FOR THE HYDROTEST.  THE PIPELINE WAS HANDED OVER FROM CONSTRUCTION TO OPERATIONS AS COMPLETE AND READY FOR SERVICE.  OPERATIONS BEGAN START-UP OF THE PIPELINE WHEN A LEAKING FLANGE AT VALVE SITE #6 ON ONE OF THE 2 inch VALVES DOWNSTREAM OF THE 8 inch VALVE WAS REPORTED.  OPERATIONS SHUT THE PIPELINE DOWN THEN CONFIRMED THE LEAK.  THE INITIAL CAUSE OF THE LEAK APPEARS TO BE LOOSE FLANGE BOLTS ON THE 2 inch VALVE ASSEMBLY.  THE FLANGE BOLTS WERE TIGHTENED TO ELIMINATE THE LEAK AND CLEAN-UP WAS INITIATED.  THIS REPORT REFLECTS THE CORRECTED GPS FOR THE RELEASE LOCATION FROM THE ORIGINAL REPORTED COORDINATES ON THE NRC REPORT.

THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE RELEASE IS NOT KNOWN AT THIS TIME OF THIS REPORT'S ORIGINAL SUBMITTAL.  METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS WILL BE CONDUCTED ON REMOVED SECTION OF PIPE TO DETERMINE THE CAUS. UPDATE: AUGUST 23, 2013  O THE LEAK AT THE GIRTH WELD WAS FOUND TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY A CRACK THAT INITIATED AT AN AREA OF INADEQUATE PENETRATION AND INCOMPLETE FUSION AT THE WELD ROOT, AND AT THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF A REPAIR WELD AT THE LOCATION OF THE CRACK.  O THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT THIS CRACK HAD GROWN AS A RESULT OF FATIGUE, SO IT IS LIKELY THAT THIS CRACK HAS BEEN PRESENT SINCE THE TIME OF CONSTRUCTION.  O IT IS NOT EVIDENT WHAT CAUSED THE CRACK TO LEAK WHEN IT DID.  SOME FORM OF AXIAL STRESS MAY HAVE CAUSED THE CRACK TO OPEN SLIGHTLY (I.E. SOIL MOVEMENT, BENDING). UPDATE FROM FINAL REPORT MARCH 14, 2014  THE LEAK IN GIRTH WELD 71+64 WAS CAUSED BY A CRACK THAT INITIATED AT AN AREA OF INADEQUATE PENETRATION (IP) AND INCOMPLETE FUSION (IF) AT THE WELD ROOT NEAR THE TOP BUTTON OF THE GIRTH WELD. THE IP AND IF DEFECTS ACTED AS STRESS CONCENTRATORS. AT THE SAME POSITION ON THE GIRTH WELD, A REPAIR WAS VISUALLY EVIDENT. REPAIRS TYPICALLY REPRESENT A STRESS CONCENTRATION BECAUSE OF THE ADDITIONAL RESTRAINT ASSOCIATED WITH THE LIMITED SIZE OF THE WELD REPAIR CAVITY. BOTH THE BASE WELD AND REPAIR WELD APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED USING THE GAS METAL ARC WELDING (GMAW) PROCESS.  THE IP AND IF DEFECTS WERE PRESENT AT THE TIME OF CONSTRUCTION. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE CRACK HAD ENLARGED IN SERVICE (E.G. FATIGUE CRACK GROWTH), SO IT IS LIKELY THAT THE CRACK THROUGH THE REPAIR WELD WAS ALSO PRESENT AT THE TIME OF CONSTRUCTION. THEREFORE, SOME OTHER MECHANISM MUST HAVE CAUSED THE FINAL FAILURE OF A THIN REMAINING LIGAMENT OR SOME AXIAL STRESS MUST HAVE CAUSED THE CRACK TO OPEN SLIGHTLY, ALLOWING PRODUCT TO ESCAPE. THE PRECISE REASON FOR THE LEAK OCCURRING WHEN IT DID IS NOT OBVIOUS. HOWEVER, BECAUSE NO REMAINING LIGAMENT WAS VISIBLE ON THE FRACTURE SURFACE, THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO WAS AN INCREASE IN THE AXIAL STRESS ACTING ON THE GIRTH WELD, SUCH AS SOIL MOVEMENT OR SETTLEMENT, WHICH CAUSED THE CRACK TO OPEN ENOUGH TO LEAK."

NOTE: THE FORM WILL NOT ALLOW A DATE PREVIOUS TO THE ACCIDENT DATE AND TIME.   A NUSTAR EMPLOYEE ARRIVED ON SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 20:20 AND CONFIRMED THE AMMONIA SMELL. NUSTAR RESOURCES WERE MOBILIZED TO THE SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 07:00 ON 5/7. EXCAVATION UNCOVERED A LEAKING STOPPLE TEE AT 09:55 ON 5/7. THE LEAK WAS COMING FROM THE HORIZONTAL WELD ON A STOPPLE TEE. A REPORTABLE QUANTITY WAS DETERMINED AT 10:50 ON 5/7 AND THE NRC, STATE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, AND LOCAL LEPC WERE GIVEN TELEPHONE NOTIFICATION.  THE STOPPLE TEE WAS CUT OUT, A PUP JOINT INSTALLED AND THE LINE WAS RETURNED TO SERVICE AT 10:50 ON 5/9/13. THE REMOVED STOPPLE TEE HAS BEEN SENT TO A METALLURGIST FOR ANALYSIS. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:  THE PIPE DIAMETER IS 8 INCH.  APPROXIMATELY 90 CUBIC YARDS OF SOIL WAS REMOVED.  METALLURGICAL SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION: THE LEAK WAS CAUSED BY A FATIGUE CRACK THAT DEVELOPED IN THE LONGITUDINAL SEAM WELD OF THE STOPPLE FITTING.  THE CRACK INITIATED AT AN AREA OF MISALIGNMENT OF THE CUFF EDGES AND INADEQUATE WELD PENETRATION; A FABRICATION DEFECT CREATED WHEN THE FITTING WAS INSTALLED ON THE PIPELINE.  THE INCOMPLETE ROOT PASS CREATED A NOTCH-LIKE STRESS CONCENTRATION WHICH ALLOWED FOR THE INITIATION OF A CRACK.  THE CRACK PROPAGATED BY FATIGUE FROM OPERATING PRESSURE FLUCTUATIONS UNTIL IT WAS NEARLY THROUGH THE WELD.  THE REMAINING INTACT LIGAMENT WAS UNABLE TO CONTAIN THE INTERNAL LINE PRESSURE."

THE CRCT EMPLOYEES NOTICED A LEAK ON THE PIG TRAP 2 INCH DRAIN VALVE AND PERCEIVED THE ISSUE AS AN EMERGENCY SITUATION THAT COULD EASILY BE CORRECTED.  IN THE ABSENCE OF AN OQ EMPLOYEE, THE CRCT EMPLOYEE ATTEMPTED TO TIGHTEN THE VALVE IN AN EFFORT TO STOP THE LEAK WHEN THE THREADED CONNECTION FAILED.  THE FAILURE OF THE THREADED CONNECTION ALLOWED THE VALVE BODY WITH THE ATTACHED NIPPLE AND ELBOW TO SHOOT OFF OF THE END OF THE DRAIN LINE ABOUT 10 TO 15 FEET AWAY.  ONE EMPLOYEE STATED THAT HE WAS SPRAYED WITH CRUDE OIL WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED. HE THEN IMMEDIATELY UNLOCKED AND CLOSED THE MAINLINE VALVES TO DEPRESSURIZE THE PIG TRAP AND STOP THE RELEASE OF CRUDE OIL.  ONCE THE LEAK WAS POSITIVELY ISOLATED, THE EMPLOYEE NOTIFIED HIS SUPERVISOR, OF THE INCIDENT AS WELL AS REQUESTING CLEANUP ASSISTANCE.  CRCT PERSONNEL USED A VACUUM TRUCK, TO REMOVE FREE OIL FROM LOCATION WHERE IT HAD ACCUMULATED.   AN ABSORBENT PRODUCT CALLED SPHAG SORB WAS SPREAD LIBERALLY OVER THE AFFECTED AREA IN AN ATTEMPT TO COLLECT AND REMAINING OIL.  A CRCT SUPERVISOR WALKED ALONG THE CREEK AREA, DID NOT OBSERVE ANY OIL, AND BELIEVED THAT THEY HAD CLEANED UP THE SPILLED OIL.  THE INITIAL CLEAN-UP OPERATIONS WERE TERMINATED AT 15:20 HOURS.  COFFEYVILLE RESOURCES REFINERY SECURITY CONTROL WAS CALLED AT 19:58 HOURS BY THE WINFIELD POLICE DEPARTMENT AND NOTIFIED THAT THE WINFIELD FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD REPORTED A SMALL LEAK AT THE PIG TRAP SITE HAD REACHED THE CREEK.  SECURITY CONTROL MADE CONTACT WITH CRCT EHS, AT 20:06 HOURS WHO THEN NOTIFIED CRCT PIPELINE INTEGRITY MANAGER.  AT THAT POINT THE SPILL BECAME REPORTABLE TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER, KDHE, KDEM, AND THE COWLEY COUNTY LEPC AND NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE.  UPON ARRIVAL CRCT PERSONNEL OBSERVED THAT OIL HAD MADE ITS WAY TO THE CREEK AND WAS VISIBLE ON THE ICE THAT REMAINED IN THE CREEK.  IT WAS NOTED THAT THE WATER DID NOT APPEAR TO BE MOVING VERY FAST AT THE TIME.  CRCT DEPLOYED THE VACUUM TRUCK ALONG WITH BOOMS AND ABSORBENT TO REMOVE THE OIL AND CONTAIN THE SPILL AREA FOR CLEAN-UP.  CLEANUP OPERATIONS WERE COMPLETED ON 1/13/2014.
